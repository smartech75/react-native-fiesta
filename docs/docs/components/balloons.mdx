A set of balloons which you can use to celebrate things like birthdays, anniversaries, weddings or whatever other special ocassion you can think of, in your application.

- Set of balloons
- Single balloon

### Set of balloons

```js
import { StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';
import { Balloons } from 'react-native-fiesta';

function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Balloons />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
});
```

### Single balloon

You can also use a single balloon. Notice that you need to wrap the balloon with a `Canvas`, not doing this will crash the application since we need to run the animation inside a `Canvas`.

```js
import { StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import { Canvas } from '@shopify/react-native-skia';
import { Balloon } from 'react-native-fiesta';

function App() {
  return (
    <Canvas style={styles.canvas}>
      <Balloon x={50} y={50} color={'rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.4)'} depth={0.4} />
    </Canvas>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  canvas: {
    flex: 1,
  },
});
```
